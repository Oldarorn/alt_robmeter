# Altered Robmeter

First thing first : I'm not the creator of this resource, it's just a remake from [TC Robemeter](https://github.com/TonyCapon3/tc-robmeter) that I have done to fit with my own needs.

What's that thing ? It's a simple illegal resource which let your criminals rob parkmeters from the whole map.

# Dependencies / Installation

**REQUIRED**
 - [Ox Lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib) locales, notifications, skillcheck... 
 - [Ox Inventory](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory) 
 - [Ox Target](https://github.com/overextended/ox_target) because who doesn't use a good target resource nowadays ?

**OPTIONNAL**
 - [LockPick](https://github.com/baguscodestudio/lockpick)
 - [Mrs. BzZz's lockpicks](https://bzzz.tebex.io/package/5662374) (It's free !)

 Basically you have nothing to do to make it work, just read the config and add your own language in the locales folder. 

 Everything is explained in Config.lua so, RTFC :D !
